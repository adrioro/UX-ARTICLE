                    <p>Today is the day we realize that our page does not work as
                         espected. Too often, our customers leave the site on that
                         particular
                         page, as they try to add items to the shopping cart. Many users
                         struggle to find items. Others wander around to never come back.
                         We face doubt and uncertainty as questions come to our mind
                         frantically. What is stopping my customers from converting?
                         Where all my investment went to? What did I do wrong?</p>
                    <p>Usability testing is an irreplaceable usability practice. It
                         offers an important number of benefits, and it does not
                         require
                         to make a big investment, own a test lab, recruit dozens of
                         participants, or be a usability expert. Indeed, anybody
                         interested in improving a product's usability could perform
                         sufficient testing, to discover the product's main problems
                         and
                         other issues that might be interfering with your website's
                         performance. It all comes down to one concept. To learn if
                         a
                         product is useful, we need to watch people using it.
                         How many users will we need? Three participants will do.
                         This is
                         the idea. It is not necessary to embark on a tedious and
                         expensive project. Big testing is not what helps us improve
                         our
                         product. We do not need to gather analytic data or follow
                         strict
                         test protocol. We only need to identify the main usability
                         problems. How do we achieve that? The answer is, testing
                         periodically with a small number of participants. Gather
                         enough
                         information to work with the resources we have, at the
                         speed we
                         can afford is what we need. It will minimize the risk of
                         facing
                         big scale redesign processes. The small investment strategy
                         will
                         pay off, by revealing the degree to which the product meets
                         the
                         usability expectations.</p>
                    <h1>FEWER PARTICIPANTS, HIGHER FREQUENCY, BETTER UNDERSTANDING</h1>
                    <p>No universal rules exist when it comes to usability testing.
                         Different situations require diverse strategies. However,
                         usability testing using a small number of participants
                         suits
                         most cases. Most particularly if our product has not
                         completed
                         its development cycle and when our budget is limited.
                         Frequent
                         testing with a small number of participants requires fewer
                         resources, and it is financially more manageable and
                         accessible
                         than performing big scale testing at one time. In addition
                         to
                         that, the sooner we start testing, the safer the process
                         becomes. We will walk on solid ground. Testing with a small
                         number of participants will save us time and money. It is
                         more
                         tune with the characteristics of the Design Thinking
                         process. It
                         will progressively help us understand how real users think,
                         behave and think. It will bring more ideas and
                         collaboration.</p>
                    <p>Let's make a deeper analysis of some of the many interesting
                         advantages that usability-testing offers follow.</p>
                    <h2>1-UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN NEEDS THROUGH SMALL FREQUENT
                         TESTING.</h2>
                    <p>Small frequent testing helps us understand the
                         general
                         aspects of our product value from the user's
                         perspective
                         and the human needs involved. The statistical
                         significance
                         that traditional testing provides is not crucial
                         to
                         usability study. Usability testing has the
                         purpose of
                         understanding the user's behavior rather than
                         making
                         generalizations based on general populations, as
                         academic
                         research does. Qualitative questions concern us.
                         Does our
                         product support the user's task within a goal? Is
                         it
                         consistent? Does our product/site communicate the
                         intended
                         workflow? How does the user feel when he or she
                         interacts
                         with our product? Does the content speak the
                         language of
                         our audience? We do not need statistical
                         significance to
                         answer these questions. Usability testing with a
                         small
                         number of participants will do the job
                         sufficiently. It
                         will allow us to understand if our product works
                         as we
                         expected. It will give us valuable insights; and
                         the
                         opportunity to define and fix any potential
                         problems.</p>
                    <h2>2-A FEW PARTICIPANTS WILL REVEAL THE MAIN
                         PROBLEMS.</h2>
                    <p>Testing with a small number of participants
                         will reveal the
                         most important problems in a hierarchical
                         order. According
                         to Dr. Robert Virzi's research on usability
                         evaluation, the
                         first participants will reveal the greater
                         number of
                         usability problems, and the ones ranked high
                         in severity.
                         "The important lessons tend to be obvious to
                         everyone who's
                         watching," says Steve Krug, the author of
                         Don't Make Me
                         Think. From that perspective, achieving
                         statistical
                         significance will be irrelevant in most
                         cases. At the early
                         stages of development, detecting only the
                         main issues is
                         crucial. It will accelerate the process,
                         save us money, and
                         resources by providing us with only the
                         information that we
                         need at that time. Unless our product is up
                         and running, we
                         will be looking for broad issues of quality
                         rather than
                         quantity. Obvious problems rather than
                         blemishes. This
                         procedure will make the process more agile
                         because it will
                         increase our opportunities to iterate. It
                         will also ensure
                         better solutions to radical issues.</p>
                    <h2>3-MORE SUBJECTS WILL NOT REVEAL MORE
                         IMPORTANT PROBLEMS.</h3>
                         <p>The addition of subjects will not uncover
                              more relevant
                              problems. The research mentioned has
                              demonstrated that to
                              uncover most of the usability problems
                              we need a few
                              subjects. Specifically, three subjects
                              will uncover 65% of
                              the problems, and only two more, five
                              subjects, will
                              uncover 80%. To uncover 95% of the
                              issues, we need an
                              average of 9 participants. Using 15
                              users, we would
                              discover all the usability problems in
                              the design.
                              Additional participants will not
                              uncover new main problems.
                              We want to reveal the problems we have
                              the resources to fix
                              at a time. We need to face the problems
                              as we can solve
                              them, prioritizing the major issues.
                              Going by stages then
                              is a good strategy for iteration and
                              collaboration between
                              users and designers, especially if our
                              resources are
                              limited. We do not need more than two
                              or three participants
                              to accomplish this goal.</p>
                         <h2>4-MORE EXPENSIVE IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER.</h3>
                              <p>Small testing is affordable.
                                   Achieving statistical
                                   significance would require using a
                                   high number of
                                   participants. This is only one of
                                   the reasons why it is so
                                   expensive. However, high-cost is
                                   not directly proportional
                                   to the number-of-benefits when it
                                   comes to usability
                                   testing. Not in those cases when
                                   the product development
                                   cycle has not been completed.
                                   Let's imagine we are
                                   designing a site that is still in
                                   development and we decide
                                   to use statistical significance
                                   instead. Any hypotheses we
                                   may create for it would be useful
                                   at that particular time
                                   only. A hypothesis created from a
                                   dysfunctional product
                                   will retrieve reliable empirical
                                   data, but it will be valid
                                   for a short period of time, as the
                                   product will need to
                                   continue transiting its

                                   would be wasted. Furthermore, if

                                   limited, we will have lost the
